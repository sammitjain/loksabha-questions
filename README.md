# loksabha-questions
Questions asked in the Lok Sabha - collection and analysis of trends. Creating the dataset from scratch.

Trying to do a complete analysis of the questions asked in the Lok Sabha (House of the People - lower house of the Indian Parliament).


The goal of this project is to be able to answer the following questions (work in progress):
* What are the questions that were asked by an MP?
* What are the questions being asked from a particular state?
* How many questions were asked around the topic <Topic>?
* And many more combinations of these...
  

# NOTE: 
* I do not own any of the associated data and is publicly available at http://loksabhaph.nic.in/Questions/questionlist.aspx as on December 15th, 2021. 
* Any information presented is merely an interpretation and should not be used as a substitute for real data.
* Since this project involves a lot of text analytics, natural language processing, semantic parsing of really messy data, it is prone to errors.
